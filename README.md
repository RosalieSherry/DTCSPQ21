# DTCSPQ21
My Data Translation Challenge for Dr. Khadivi's Spring Quarter 2021 Machine Learning Class
Its original goal was to find the best classifier for a small dataset, however as the project went on the conclusion was to be had that none of the classifiers were very good. So, with this in mind the project was then shifted to prove, that the larger the training dataset the more accurate it is for the test dataset. Decisions of which classifiers were used would be found in the file DTC.py where as the code used to prove the test and train is in the file, Final_DTC.py. 

This project may have benefitted from dimensionality reduction or an increase in dataset size.
